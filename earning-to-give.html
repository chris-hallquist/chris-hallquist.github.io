				<h1>Earning to Give</h1>
				<p>This is the virtual handout for my talk on earning to give. It's pretty bare-bones at the moment, but may be expanded in the future. People with further questions, especially about getting a programming job, should feel free to <a href="mailto:challquist@gmail.com">e-mail me</a>.</p>
				<p>Some general links on earning to give:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://80000hours.org/">80,000 Hours</a>: 80,000 Hours has a <i>ton</i> of great career advice geared towards effective altruists. They have so many great pages and blog posts, it would be futile to try to link to them all here. However, their introductory page on earning to give can be found <a href="http://80000hours.org/earning-to-give">here</a>. It should be emphasized that they don't claim earning to give is right for everyone, something you can read more about <a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/191-why-earning-to-give-is-often-not-the-best-option">. On the contrary, 80,000 Hours has a lot of great information that will be useful for weighing earning to give against other options for your particular case.</li>

						<li>This <a href="http://www.stafforini.com/blog/writings-on-earning-to-give-an-annotated-bibliography/">bibliography</a> on earning to give may also be helpful.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Since learning to program is high on the list of things you can do once you've already gotten your degree that will increase your earning potential, it deserves special attention here. Links relevant to learning to program:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://www.appacademy.io/?referer=Chris+Hallquist">App Academy</a>: App Academy is how I got my programming job, and I can't recommend it highly enough. Getting in is hard, but if you're able to get in, there's probably no better way to learn to program. Also, if you're good at math, you might be surprised by how simple the entrance coding challenge is. <b>The link on this page is my referrer link, and if you use it to apply, I'll get a substantial commission if you're accepted, 100% of which I will donate to effective charities.</b></li>
					<li><a href="http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/learn-code/">So You Wanna Learn How to Code? Going from Zero to Programmer Hero in One Guide, for Great Justice</a>: a guide on Peter Hurford's blog Everyday Utilitarian. This is a <i>really</i> good guide, in large part because Peter got a bunch of different people to contribute to it (myself included, though I can only claim responsibility for a fraction of it).</li>
					<li><a href="http://80000hours.org/blog/329-interview-with-buck-shlegeris-from-app-academy">80,000 Hours Interview with Buck Shlegeris</a>: Buck is a good friend of mineâ€”we went through App Academy together, and he's currently working there as a TA. The interview is probably worth reading if you're considering applying to App Academy.</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/hallq/2014/06/so-youre-thinking-of-applying-to-app-academy/">So you're thinking of applying to App Academy</a>: a blog post I wrote to cover a few gaps in the previous two links.</li>
					<li><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/hd1/maximizing_your_donations_via_a_job/">Maximizing Your Donations via a Job</a> by Alexei. Focused on programmers, though Alexei says he thinks it will have valuable information for non-programmers too. Focuses on the interview process and salary negotiation, which a lot of guides to learning to program omit.</li>
					<li><a href="http://rationalconspiracy.com/2012/07/09/getting-a-software-job/">Getting a Software Job</a> by Alyssa Vance. This is an older post, but it helped me when I was first considering getting in to programming as a career.</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/hallq/2014/06/philosophy-vs-programming/">Philosophy vs. programming</a>: I compare philosophy and programming as career choices.</li>
